The 'Tablist' is started with a right click on the right edge of the video or editor window (20 pixels).

Execute menu:

In the context menu of the 'Tablist' there is a menu entry 'Execute menu', this entry must first be configured under Program Options > Misc 2 > 'Tablist execute menu'.
Up to 10 custom menu entries can be added. The separator for a new entry is a , comma. The separator for the label and the command to be executed is a |
And then there is a separator for searching the menu entries ->

So: Save script|File -> Save script (displayed label|menu to be executed)
Instead of writing the menu to be executed, the shortcut to the menu can also be used. Save script|Ctrl+Shift+S

Macros can also be started from the Macros menu. An example for 3 menu entries (You can copy and paste it): 
Save script (GPo)|Macros -> Save script (GPo), Add tab to group 1|Video -> Add tab to group -> 1, Clear all tab groups|Video -> Add tab to group -> Clear all tab groups
